      "1. **Analyze Request & Update Documentation**: For any new feature or significant change, first update the relevant design/requirements document (e.g., 'project_goals.rst', 'architecture.rst').",
      "2. **Request Review**: After updating the documentation, explicitly ask for my (the user's) review and approval before proceeding.",
      "3. **Implement Code**: Once the documentation changes are approved, write or modify the code. The code must strictly follow the approved design and 'coding_style.rst'.",
      "4. **Write/Update Tests**: Accompany new code with corresponding unit or integration tests.",
      "5. **Final Review**: When the implementation and tests are complete, present the code changes (as a diff) for a final review."

    "rule": "NEVER write code for a new feature before the supporting documentation is updated and approved by the user."
